Unity Project for Ludum Dare 32 project - Streets of encouRAGE

This is an old school Greet 'em up. Move across the screen and hi5 the sad sacks. It's pretty much just a functional prototype at this point. Might flesh it out into a whole game one day though.

You can play it on the web [here](http://dev.kojokumah.com/LDJAM/32/encouRAGE/). You'll want to use Firefox, IE or Safari. The Unity web player doesn't really work in Chrome anymore.
